This project exists to **provide a semi-trusted source of Minetest Mods**.
Mods here should be stable (at least in the master branches).
All mods should work well together.

## How is a Mod added?

The original author of the Mod should be the one submitting it to the minetest-mods
project. Under circumstances (abandoned, author not responsive etc.) we will consider
forks. To submit your project to be added and become the maintainer of a project, submit
a new github issue.

In your request, please provide the following information:

* your mod name
* author (github username)
* the license(s) of your mod

By submitting a project, you acknowledge that you agree to the rules in the [manifest](README.html)

Click here: [Open Request](https://github.com/minetest-mods/minetest-mods.github.io/issues/new?title=New%20mod%20request)

After opening a request ticket, you will be asked to initiate a "Transfer" request to move your mod. If you want to fork your moved repository back, you are obviously free to do so. You will be granted admin access on the moved repository. More information on the "Transfer" procedure can be found here: [Transfer Information](https://help.github.com/articles/transferring-a-repository/)

We also send all mod owners a "become a member of minetest-mods" invitation. This invitation does not need to be accepted, and is merely for you (and us) to show who is participating in the minetest-mods organization. You do not require the invite. If you missed it, and would still like to become a listed member, please request another invitation.

## Can any Minetest mod be added?

* Mods should preferrably be licensed under an OSI approved license.
* Mods do not need to be minetest-licensing compatible (meaning, GPL3.0+ is fine)
* Non-OSI licenses may be acceptable.
* Public Domain is not defined well in many countries, so licenses such as WTFPL,
  MIT or CC0 should be used.

## What's in it for users?

* A central place to find well-maintained mods.
* Clarity as to which fork is the recommended version of a mod.
* Well-defined mods with proper metadata that work without renaming and installation issues.
* The security of knowing many more developers are looking at mod code than just one person.

## What's in it for developers?
* Knowing that they can take a break from Minetest when they need or choose to, and that someone will be capable of taking care of their mods.
* A large group of experienced mod developers that are willing to help out improve their code.
* More users looking at their mods and better exposure.
